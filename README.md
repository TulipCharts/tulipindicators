# Tulip Indicators

## Introduction

Tulip Indicators is a library of technical analysis functions written in ANSI C.

Lots of information is available on the website:
[https://tulipindicators.org](https://tulipindicators.org)

High quality bindings are available for [Node.js](https://github.com/TulipCharts/tulipnode),
[Python](https://github.com/cirla/tulipy), and [.NET](https://github.com/TulipCharts/tinet).

## Features

 - **ANSI C with no dependencies**.
 - Uses fast algorithms.
 - Easy to use programming interface.
 - Release under LGPL license.


## Building

Building is easy. You only need a decent C compiler. Tulip Indicators has no
other dependencies.

Just download the code and run `make`.

```
git clone https://github.com/TulipCharts/tulipindicators
cd tulipindicators
make
```

You should get a static library, `libindicators.a`. You'll need that library
and the header file `indicators.h` to use Tulip Indicators in your code.

## Usage

For usage information, please see:
